# The program must accept an integer matrix of size RÂ°C containing only Os and is as the input.
# The program must find the biggest plus sign (+) formed by 1s in the given matrix.
# Then the program must print the length of the edge of the biggest plus sign (Edge length = the number of cells from the middle cell of the plus sign to one of the four ends). 
# All four edges of the plus sign must be equal.
# If the plus sign is not present in the matrix, then the program must print -1 as the output.
