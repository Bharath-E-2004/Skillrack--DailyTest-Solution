/*
  The program must accept a string S and print the string power P based on the statements below.

- When a character occurs for the first time in the string, its power is 1.

- When a character occurs for the second time or more, its power is twice the previous value.

- P is the sum of the individual powers of the characters in S.

- A character has zero power after it has occurred more than T times in a string.

Boundary Condition(s):

1<= Length of S <= 100

1 <= T <= 15

Input Format:

The first line contains S.

The second line contains T.

Output Format: The first line contains P.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input: engine 10

Output: 8

Explanation:

The powers of the characters are e-1, n-1, g-1, 1-1, n-2, e-2 and their sum is 8.

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:

5

Output: 18

Explanation:

The powers of the characters are a-1, a-2, b-1, a-4, a-8, b-2 and their sum is 18.
